Open your SQL environment (phpMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench).

Create a new database and name it "db_sample".

For example: C:\information management\htdocs\

Make sure the project path looks like this:
C:\information management\htdocs\shop

Start Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP Control Panel.

Open your web browser and go to:
